Course Outline


## Class 1
- Start by brief discussion of experience with A-Frame so far
- This class:

"3 Things Getting on My Nerves"

a) Make one word shrink
Play: what other effects could you have?

b) Make them shrink if you click on one of them


NOTE: do I want to also include creating them from a list?


## Class 2
- Create your own tag/primitive
Start from stuff from class 1, than play with your own ideas

- Simple example: a grid

- Figuring out someone else's code:  Flinging Blocks


After the training:
what have we learned about what's easy and hard?

Switch to creating a training and smoothing the learning curve? A.k.a. drop the projects
