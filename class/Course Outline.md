Course Outline

Class 1: Mixins and Creating Components


Class 2: Templates and Creating Primitives
After the training:
- what have we learned about what's easy and hard?
- Switch to creating a training and smoothing the learning curve? A.k.a. drop the projects


NOTE: if I was teaching a regular class, I wouldn't do it this way -- this is way too quick. But in this case, my goal is to give our team a rough overview of the pieces of the puzzle so we can start wrapping our heads around what trainings and a community of learners might need to accomplish.



Class 3: Figuring out someone else's code:  Flinging Blocks
Before the class: discussion: where do we go from here? How do we scope out what we need to do to build a training/ecosystem? Definitely don't want to try to build all of it, but do need enough that first steps are clear and we feel like we have some clue.
NOTE: there is an advantage to starting to train the trainers right away, at least with a small core group, to start trying out our ideas. How do I ask for help here? The big thing: examples, which means people need to play around -- and then post them on slack? With a hashtag?

Class 4: using the browser development tools
