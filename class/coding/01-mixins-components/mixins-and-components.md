## Class 1: Mixins and Writing Components


Start by brief discussion of experience with A-Frame so far

This class:
- Only briefly going to discuss mixins


### 1) Mixins
- For simple reusable, for abstracting away a bit

Example:  "3 Things Getting on My Nerves"

bugs-me-less

Make one word shrink
Make a word become slightly opaque

### 2) Redo Mixin as Component


### Write Your Own Component

Implement what we just did
Play: what other effects could you have? Check out the documentation for ideas (I need a link)

### 3)  Clickable


### 4) Parameter?  or changes per click?

What you can't do with mixins: Passing a property: how much does it bug me?

Adding Interaction: Make them shrink if you click on one of them



NOTE: although uses JavaScript, that's not the part was the biggest learning curve. The big piece is learning the model, learning which components other people have created are worth using.

Ex:  subtracting from sale:  need vector 3(?)
