## Class 2: Templates and Primitives

### Templates
Use example with some simple data -- maybe from my D3 class?
Then step back and say, but for real, would you want to do that if you are visualizing data? All the different pieces you might need -- that would be a huge drag.

### Create your own tag/primitive
What example to start with?

Then show them iterative component?

Finish up with: a grid: amazing what you can do if you take advantage of what's already built in




After the training:
what have we learned about what's easy and hard?

Switch to creating a training and smoothing the learning curve? A.k.a. drop the projects
