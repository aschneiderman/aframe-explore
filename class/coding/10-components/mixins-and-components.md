## Class 1: Writing Components

[NOTE: in my outline for the session, have instructor's note:
Make sure everyone is comfortable reading HTML
Ask people about their experience using HTML with A-Frame so far, get a show of hands to see who has done so
]


### 1) Redo Mixin as Component

Example:  "3 Things Getting on My Nerves"

bugs-me-less

Make a word become slightly opaque

[NOTE: remind people about the debugger: with JavaScript and with HTML, if it breaks it won't tell you on the screen]

### Write Your Own Component

Try changing the color

### 2) Parameter
What you can't do with mixins: Passing a property: how much does it bug me?

### 3)  Clickable

### 4)  Clicking One Element Affects Another


NOTE: although uses JavaScript, that's not the part was the biggest learning curve. The big piece is learning the model, learning which components other people have created are worth using.

Ex:  subtracting from sale:  need vector 3(?)
