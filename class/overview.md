## Overview

This class: v 0.1

This class assumes you know basic coding -- "if"



NOTE: for the beginning class, need a "what is coding?" (E.g., Boss' Idiot Nephew)


Our course teaches just enough JavaScript that you want to take a JavaScript class
each new lesson from that class will feel like it's adding a tool to your toolbox, increasing your ability to express yourself



What did developers do who aren't writing the training?
- Learn by doing a component, like physics engine, or vectors, and create a library of simple examples: for the trainees, that others can learn from
- Write simple examples that can used in the training for teaching the very beginnings of JavaScript e.g., if then, loops
- Try writing components that hide the icky stuff
- Try extending the Inspector?
- Play with Vue.js, React.JS, d3.io
- pick a small personal project you think will propel this forward. For example, building a virtual postcard in a way that would make smoothing the learning curve easy, as a simple proof of concept (use the Inspector)
Let's brainstorm about this: our goals, what do developers do, who signs up for what? What do you think is fun or want to develop and would move the project forward

Keep it small: little chunks, don't set big expectations

Do tutorials designed for
- a Friday-Saturday class (my idea on how)
- a weekly study group (my "Band of Brothers and Sisters")


What are the skills and "levels" of someone who is a beginning developer in A-Frame, more experienced developer? Then how do you "level up"?
